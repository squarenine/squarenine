Hello there!
Currently completing the GCSE CS course, and heading onto A-Level Computer Science
I am a programmer interested in utilising Python for a space-themed JRPG, and will be more than willing to have creators assist in sprite generation.
Feel free to email zenopeternorris@gmail.com for any ideas, I'm all ears!
