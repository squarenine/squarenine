I am working on a sci-fi open-world-ish game similar in style to the most notable creations made by Hoyoverse, like the Honkai series and Genshin Impact.
Currently the whole code is made in Python, and will be compiled into an .exe once finished.

Contact me if you have ideas, materials or expertise to contribute
